<h2>About me</h2>
I am a biologist by training with an interest in the analysis and visualization of data. My graduate studies concerned nuclear-receptor signaling in human cancers employing wet-lab and computational tools. Outside of research I indulge in soccer, food, and music. I am a proud speaker of Mexican Spanish.
