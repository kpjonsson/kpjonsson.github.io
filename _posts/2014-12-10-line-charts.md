In my endeavour to learn d3.js I find its creator Mike Bostock's set of [bl.ocks](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/) a very useful resource. One of the most challenging parts is the reading and processing of data files and by looking at his examples I believe I'm starting to get a grasp of it. Here I created a line chart with stock data downloaded from Yahoo! Finance. Source code available [here](https://github.com/kpjonsson/kpjonsson.github.io/blob/master/js/multi-line-chart.js). An example of a simpler line graph with randomly generated data can be found in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/kpjonsson/ad16a94884f3e0e21f52).
