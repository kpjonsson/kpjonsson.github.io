This is my first attempt at making a data visualization using [d3.js](d3js.org). I chose to illustrate the distribution of seats in the Swedish parliament, since the intention to hold new election was newly announced. As can be seen, neither of the two coalition groups can hold a majority with the wild-card party the Sweden Democrats. The plot includes some interactive mouse-over effects. The code is [here](https://github.com/kpjonsson/kpjonsson.github.io/blob/master/js/general-election-2014.js).
